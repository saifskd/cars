                with the experience of the people who use them. Therefore, Concept-i was built from the inside out, with
                a focus on making it immersive, energetic and, most importantly‚Äîapproachable.

                center of the dashboard throughout the vehicle, while Yui travels around them, using light, sound and
                even touch to communicate critical information. It utilizes a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color
                Head-Up Display that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered.

                ability can enjoy the ride. You're still in charge of the car. However, through biometric sensors
                throughout the car, Concept-i can detect what you're feeling. That information then gets analyzed by the
                car's AI. That's when the automated features kick in.
